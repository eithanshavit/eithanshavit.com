      <h1>AdidasGymnastics.com</h1>
      <p>e-commerce website for Adidas gymnastics clothing.</p>
      <p>Running on an old Coldfusion code base, this websites requires a lot of 
      maintenance and added features which I am responsible for, as well as server
      maintenance and general web admin. What makes this project interesting in my
      eyes, is that I needed to learn a new Web development language and framework from
      scratch.
      <p>This is the first large scale website with active international customers that I
      am solely resposible for. It's a challenging and rewarding experience.</p>

      <h1>zeshesham.com</h1>
      <p>This is a customized WordPress PHP website.</p>
      <p>It is a recipe blog, combined with creative short stories. My good friend is
      the writer, cook, and photographer, while I build and maintain the website, and
      edit the photos.</p>
      <p>To develop and launch the website, I used an Amazon Web Services VPS. 
      Since this is a non-profit website, the virtual server we used had very limited
      resources. This brought up some scalability challenges, as more and more people
      started to use our website. To run a real website on a VM with less than 5% CPU time and 600Mb RAM,
      some MySql, Apache and virtual memory tricks were used. When development was
      done, we moved to a shared hosting solution in order to save some money.</p>
      <p>It's great fun working on such a website that combines art, food, and web
      development.</p>
