      <h1>Verbal Clock</h1>
      <p>One day, as I was visiting <a target="_blank" href="http://mindtribe.com/">MindTribe</a>, I
      noticed a really cool clock hanging on the wall of their lounge area. I thought to
      myself that "this shouldn't be too difficult to make". It turned out to be more
      challenging than I thought, and I learned a lot in the process.</p>

      <p>The interesting aspect of this project was combining different types of
      engineering into one final product. I decided to go with an Arduino controller
      as the brain, connected to many LEDs. The front panel is laser cut from Acrylic
      plastic, and each LED sits behind a word cutout and lights up when the time is
      right. The whole thing goes into a nice wooden frame.</p>
      <div class="images-loaded-container">
         <div class="post-gallery">
            <ul>
               <li class="is-loading" ng-repeat="image in verbalClockImages['final']" images-loaded>
                  <a class="fancybox" href="{{image.url}}" rel="lightbox[{{image.category}}]"><img ng-src="{{image.thumbUrl}}" alt="" /></a>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
      </div>

      <p>Creating all parts of the project by myself (except for the Arduino),
      required the following steps:</p>

      <h2>Software</h2>

      <p>This was the easy part. The micro controller runs a loop that polls the real
      time clock (RTC) chip for the current time. It then calculates which words to
      light up and pushes this data serially to the LEDs.</p>

      <p>Another thing to do in the loop is debounce the on-board button and react
      to its state. I am currently using the button to activate a LEDs test mode, but
      it also supports adjusting the time.</p>

      <h2>Hardware</h2>

      <p>The first issue I encouterd using the Arduino, is the lack of IO outputs. My
      design required 24 indepented LEDs and the Arduino Uno only has around 10 GPIOs.
      The solution here is to use shift registers (I used the <a
      href="https://github.com/oogiyot/VerbalClock/raw/master/Specs/TPIC6B595.pdf">TPIC6B595</a>)
      and serially pipe the status of each bit. This uses just 3 GPIOs and works
      perfectly under the lax timing constrains of this clock.</p>

      <p>Another issue is that the Arduino's ability to keep real time is limited. We
      can manually teach it what time it is, but this will be lost on reset. I used
      the <a
      href="https://github.com/oogiyot/VerbalClock/raw/master/Specs/DS1307.pdf">DS1307</a>
      IC to keep track of the time, even after power is lost. It is connected to a
      backup battery that is activated when needed.</p>

      <p>After experimenting and testing the protoype circuit, I used <a
      target="_blank" href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com/">Eagle</a> to design and layout a PCB. <a
      target="_blank" href="http://oshpark.com/">OSH Park</a> is a great community that combines PCB
      designs from its members to efficiently fabricate small boards onto a large
      one, and keep costs down.</p>

      <h2>Plastics</h2>

      <p>I used vector graphics to create a precise design of the front panel, and
      sent it to <a target="_blank" href="http://ponoko.com/">Ponoko</a> to laser cut it.</p>

      <p>My friend's father, a carpenter, helped me create a wooden frame to hold my Hardware.</p>
