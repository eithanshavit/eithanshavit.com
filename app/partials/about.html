   <p>My name is Eithan Shavit. I have experience in software and hardware engineering, but most of all I'm drawn to art and creativity. I'm always looking for new mediums through which to express my creativity, especially through technology. And the quest to use the right and the left sides of my brain together never ends.</p>
   <p>This website is an attempt to document my experiments with various mediums such as web development, photography, hardware design, mobile apps, and carpentry.</p>
   <p>I'm currently working on a very exciting mobile app. It's too early to talk about it, so I'll keep you posted.</p>
